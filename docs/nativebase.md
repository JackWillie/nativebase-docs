title: NativeBase 3.0
---

A universal design system for mobile & web built for React Native and React with the same API. Ships a bunch of components for most of the use-cases that includes Button, AppBar, Dialog, Modal and what not.

## Why?

We want to build and ship accessible apps fast with the highest quality. We want to focus on the business logic and to solve real problems.

## Inspirations

Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Braid Design System, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, Flutter.

## API

Declarative and imperative. Declarative for components and imperative for all the actions.

## Design Principle

We have two types of components â€” Primitives and Composite.

- **Primitive components** are the building blocks.
- **Composite components** are made up of primitive components.

## Note on web support ðŸš¨

Please note that Web support is still under development. NativeBase will work on web, but we are still working towards a more comprehensive web experience for your apps.
