id: VStack
title: VStack / Column
---

`VStack` aligns items vertically.`Column` is also an alias for `VStack`.

## Import

```jsx
import { VStack } from 'native-base';
```

## Usage

```ComponentSnackPlayer path=primitives,VStack,basic.tsx

```

### Important ðŸš¨

> If you want to pass custom components (not a NativeBase imported component) as direct children of Stack, VStack, HStack, or ZStack you must wrap that in a [`Box`](box.md) for Stacks to work as expected.

## Props

```ComponentPropTable path=primitives,Stack,VStack.tsx

```
