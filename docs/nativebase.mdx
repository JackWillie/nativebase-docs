<h1>hello world</h1>
We want to build and ship high-quality apps quickly. Using NativeBase 3.0 facilitates
this and gives us room to focus on solving important business problems.

Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Braid Design System, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, Flutter.

NativeBase 3.0 is both Declarative and Imperative. It is Declarative for components and Imperative for actions.

We have two types of components â€” Primitives and Composite.

- **Primitive components** are the building blocks.
- **Composite components** are made up of primitive components.

Please note that Web support is still under development. NativeBase will work on web, but we are still working towards a more comprehensive web experience for your apps.
