id: hStack
title: HStack / Row
---

`HStack` aligns items horizontally. `Row` is also an alias for `HStack`.

## Import

```jsx
import { HStack } from 'native-base';
```

## Examples

```ComponentSnackPlayer path=primitives,HStack,basic.tsx

```

### Important ðŸš¨

> If you want to pass custom components (not a NativeBase imported component) as direct children of Stack, VStack, HStack, or ZStack you must wrap that in a [`Box`](box.md) for Stacks to work as expected.

## Props

```ComponentPropTable path=primitives,Stack,HStack.tsx

```
