title: NativeBase 3.0
---

A universal design system built for React and React Native apps with a single API. NativeBase 3.0 ships components for most use cases including Button, AppBar, Dialog, Modal, etc.

## Why?

We want to build and ship high-quality apps quickly. Using NativeBase 3.0 facilitates this and gives us room to focus on solving important business problems.

## Inspirations

Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Braid Design System, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, Flutter.

## API

NativeBase 3.0 is both Declarative and Imperative. It is Declarative for components and Imperative for actions.

## Design Principle

We have two types of components â€” Primitives and Composite.

- **Primitive components** are the building blocks.
- **Composite components** are made up of primitive components.

## Note on web support ðŸš¨

Please note that Web support is still under development. NativeBase will work on web, but we are still working towards a more comprehensive web experience for your apps.
