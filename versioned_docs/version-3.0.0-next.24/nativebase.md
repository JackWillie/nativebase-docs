A universal Design System for Mobile & Web built for React Native and React with the same API. Ships a bunch of components for most of the use-cases that includes Button, AppBar, Dialog, Modal and what not.

# Why?

We want to build and ship apps fast with the highest quality. We want to focus on the business logic and to solve real problems.

# Inspirations

Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Braid Design System, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, Flutter.

# API

Declarative and Imperative. Declarative for components and Imperative for all the actions.

# Design principle

We have two types of components â€” Primitives and Composite.

- **Primitive components** are the building blocks.
- **Composite components** are made up of primitive components.
